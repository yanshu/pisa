# PISA Terminology

* **DistributionMaker**: A collection of one or more *pipelines*; this produces the events distributions we see (in the case of data) or that we expect to see (in the case of Monte Carlo). The output of a DistributionMaker is a MapSet.

* **Map**: N-dimensional histogram, most often in energy and cosine of the zenith angle (coszen)--but the number of dimensions and the binning in each are completely configurable in PISA). Note that the binning of a map is accessed via `map.binning`.

* **MapSet**: Container or set of `Map`, with convenience methods for working with the contained maps.

* **Parameterized Monte Carlo (MC) analysis**: Start the analysis process with histogrammed fluxes. Then for each subsequent stage, modify the histogram bins' counts by the transform expected from that stage of the analysis. The transforms are derived from physical models and/or by parameterizing how the MC events were affected by this stage of processing or simulation. This is what PISA was originally designed to do, but PISA now also accommodates *reweighted MC analysis* (see definition below). Parameterized-MC analysis is more robust to low statistics (few MC events), whereas reweighted-MC analysis is more susceptible to statistical fluctuations.

* **Pipeline**: A single sequence of stages and the services implementing them for processing a single data type. E.g.:
  * There might be defined a pipeline for processing neutrinos and a separate pipeline for processing muons.
  * For neutrino mass ordering measurements, the set of pipelines to produce "template" distributions might include one neutrino pipeline for normal ordering and one neutrino pipeline for inverted ordering, in addition to a single pipeline for muons.
    * If parameters to produce the "data" distribution used to match templates to differ from the nominal values for the template pipelines, a separate set of the aforementioned pipelines can be defined to produce the "data" distribution.

* **Pipeline settings**: The collection of all parameters required (and no more) to instantiate all stages (and which service to use for each) in a single pipeline.

* **Quantity**: A number or array *with units attached*. See (units_and_uncertainties).

* **Resource**: A file with settings, simulated events, parameterizations, metadata, etc. that is used by one of the services, the template maker, the minimizer, .... Resources are found in the `$PISA/pisa/resources` directory, where a subdirectory exists for each stage (and several directories exist for resources used for other purposes).

* **Reweighted Monte Carlo (MC) analysis**: Each stage of the analysis simulates the effects of physics and detector systematics by directly modifying the MC events' characteristics (e.g., their importance weights and reconstructed properties). After applying all such effects, only in the last step are the MC events histogrammed. Contrast with *parameterized-MC analysis* (defined above), where it is histograms that are modified throughout the analysis to reflect the effects of physics and detector systematics.

* **Service**: A particular *implementation* of a stage is called a ***service***. For example, the effective areas stage (`aeff`) has services `mc` and `slice_smooth`. Each service is a python `.py` file that lives inside its stage's directory. E.g., the effective area `mc` service is at `$PISA/pisa/stages/aeff/mc.py`.

* **Sideband object**: Any objects passed as inputs to a service that are *not used* by that service (i.e., not specified by name in the `input_names` keyword argument of the `Stage.__init__` method) are called ***sideband objects***. Sideband objects pass through the stage untransformed and un-cached, and are merely tacked onto the outputs container before that object is passed on to the next stage. There is no enforcement that sideband objects *not* be used by the stage. This is at present unused by any service implementations, but allows for greater flexibility for future services.

* **Stage**: Each stage represents a critical part of the process by which we can eventually detect neutrinos. For example, atmospheric neutrinos that pass through the earth will oscillate partially into different flavors prior to reaching the IceCube/PINGU detector. This part of the process is called the **oscillations** stage. There are currently defined the stages `flux` (for neutrino flux), `osc` (neutrino oscillations), `aeff` (detector effective area), `reco` (reconstruction resolutions), and `pid` (particle identification; e.g., tracks vs. cascades). Stages are directories in the `$PISA/pisa/stages` directory.

* **Transform** / **nominal transform**: A ***transform*** is a definition of how to modify an input or inputs to produce a *single* output. A ***nominal transform*** is the transform computed with all systematics effectively turned "off" (or set to their "nominal" values). Nominal transforms are not required to produce a transform, but are a convenient and time-saving construct to use when systematics merely serve to modify some nominal transform to arrive at the final transform that will be applied to input(s) to produce an output. Nominal transforms that take more than ~1/2 sec to compute should be cached to disk for future re-use (this is done automatically by the Stage class if a disk_cache is specified within a service).
