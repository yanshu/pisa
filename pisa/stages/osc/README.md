# Stage 2: Oscillations

The purpose of this stage is to modify the modelled
atmospheric neutrino flux by applying the appropriate oscillation probability
in each energy and zenith bin through the earth, for each flavour. At
the end of the stage, the oscillated neutrino flux for each flavour is
given.

## Services

Only one service is currently supported in PISA for calculating the oscillation probabilties: `prob3cpu`.

### prob3cpu

This service calculates the neutrino oscillation probabilities using the `Prob3` code, which at its core, relies on a 3-flavour analytic solution to the neutrino oscillation propagation over constant matter density. For a realistic earth model, small enough constant density layers are chosen to accuratly describe the matter density through the earth. The `Prob3` code, initially written by the Super-Kamiokande collaboration in C/C++, is publicly available here:

http://www.phy.duke.edu/~raw22/public/Prob3++/

and has been given PyBindings as well as a few additional modifications to be optimized for the IceCube detector, and for use in PISA.

To use this service, one must set values for all of the 3-flavour oscillation parameters: `theta12`, `theta13`, `theta23`, `deltam21`, `deltam31` and `deltacp`. One can set hierarchy-dependent versions in the settings file by adding `.nh` before the name in the `params` (see `theta23` in the example pipeline settings file for more details).

The other advantage of `Prob3` is that it can fully take in to account matter effects in a very quick way. It is fed a model of the density of the Earth via the `earth_model` parameter which contains a discretised model of the Earth density. The two columns in the file are the radii of the boundaries and then densities in the sections. PISA has the 4, 10, 12 and 59 layer versions of the PReliminary Earth reference Model (PREM), the source of which can be found here:

One also has control over 3 values of the electron fraction: `YeI`, `YeM` and `YeO`, which are the values in the inner core, mantle and outer core respectively. Finally, in PISA one can set the detector depth (since the standard `Prob3` has the detector at the surface) and the height above the Earth's surface from which to begin propagation of the neutrinos.
