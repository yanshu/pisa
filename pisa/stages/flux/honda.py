"""
This flux service provides flux values from tables provided by Honda.
The returned values are in a map with binning defined by the user. Currently
this can be either 2D (energy and cosZenith) or 3D (including azimuth) though
the latter is currently rather untested. If you end up using it please keep in
contact with us so we can work through any issues together!
This is either achieved through b-spline interpolation (done in both energy and
cosZenith dimensions simultaneously in log10(flux)) or an integral-preserving
method that manipulates 1 dimensional splines of integrated flux.

Most of the functionality will be ported from PISA with any necessary
changes/improvements applied.

    """
    Flux Service for performing interpolation on the Honda tables.

    Both 2D and 3D tables can be loaded; the specifics of this are explained
    below the respective load_table function.

    Currently there are two interpolation choices:

      1) 'bisplrep' - A simple b-spline representation. This is quick.
      2) 'integral-preserving' - A slower, but more accurate choice

    These will be explained in more details in the Notes section.

    Parameters
    ----------
    params : ParamSet or sequence with which to instantiate a ParamSet.
        Expected params are:
            atm_delta_index : float
                The systematic describing the shift in the shape of the
                numu(bar) data as a function of energy relative to the
                prediction from the Honda tables.

            energy_scale : float
                A proxy systematic designed to account for any uncertainty on
                the overall energy measurements. i.e. an energy scale of 0.9
                says all energies are systematically reconstructed at 90% of
                the truth (on average). This systematic works by evaluating the
                flux splines at energy E*energy_scale and reading it in to
                energy bin E.

            nue_numu_ratio : float
                The systematic accounting for the uncertainty in the relative
                production of nue(bar) and numu(bar) in the atmosphere. It is
                implemented in a normalising-preserving way i.e. total nue +
                numu will stay constant.

            nu_nubar_ratio : float
                The systematic accounting for the uncertainty in the relative
                production of nu and nubar in the atmosphere. It is implemented
                in a normalising-preserving way i.e. total nu + nubar will stay
                constant.

            oversample_e : int
                An integer by which to oversample the requested binning in the
                energy dimension. I.e. an oversampling of 10 means the flux
                will be calculated 10 times inside each energy bin. This is
                implemented in such a way that the bins become equally split
                up.

            oversample_cz : int
                An integer by which to oversample the requested binning in the
                cosZenith dimension. All the oversampling values will end up
                effectively "multiplied" together. I.e. if you request 10
                oversampling in both energy and cosZenith directions then each
                (E,cZ) bin will have 100 evaluations inside of it.

            flux_file : str
                The name of the file containing the atmospheric neutrino files
                to be read in.

            flux_mode : str
                The name of the interpolation method to be used on these
                atmospheric neutrino flux tables. The current choices are
                'bisplrep' and 'integral-preserving'. The former is fast, but
                the latter represents a more accurate choice.

    output_binning : The binning desired for the output maps

    disk_cache : None, str, or DiskCache
        If None, no disk cache is available.
        If str, represents a path with which to instantiate a utils.DiskCache
        object. Must be concurrent-access-safe (across threads and processes).

    outputs_cache_depth : int >= 0

    memcache_deepcopy : bool

    debug_mode : None, bool, or string
        Whether to store extra debug info for this service.

    Notes
    -----
    The `outputs` container generated by this service will be objects with the
    following `name` attributes:

        * 'numu'
        * 'numubar'
        * 'nue'
        * 'nuebar'

    Corresponding to the 4 conventional atmospheric neutrino flavours.

    This service reads in a table of flux values and then performs some form of
    interpolation on them.
    It is named honda.py since it expects that these input tables come from the
    Honda group and their simulations.
    All of these tables can be found on his website [1].
    These are provided for various locations, the list of which now includes
    the South Pole as of the 2014/15 calculations.
    The details of this latest calculation are published in Physics Reviews D
    [2]:
    These tables are provided over 3 dimensions - neutrino energy, the cosine
    of the neutrino zenith angle and the azimuth of the neutrino.
    This is what is meant by a 3D flux calculation in the context of this
    service.
    Please be aware that the 3D calculations are currently untested in PISA.
    If you find any issues with them please contact the developers.
    One also deals with 2D flux calculations where the azimuth is averaged
    over.
    This is the recommended set of tables to use for the energies one is
    interested in in IceCube.
    The Honda group also provide 1D flux calculations, where all of the angles
    are averaged over i.e. they are provided solely as a function of energy.

    The tables should all follow a consistent naming convention:

    1) The first part of the file name will be which group performed the
       simulation.
       So for us they should all say honda
    2) The second part will be the year the calculations were published.
    3) The third part will be the location.
       For example, spl means the South Pole and frj means Frejus.
       There may also be the word 'mountain' here since tables have been
       produced for some detectors with and without the large matter above them
       (mostly a mountain) that purports to shield them from cosmic rays.
    4) The fourth part will be the part of the solar cycle they were produced
       for.
       Solar activity has an effect on the primaries impacting the Earth and
       therefore on the flux of atmospheric neutrinos.
       This will either be solmax or solmin, which refers to solar maximum and
       solar minimum respectively.
       Solar maximum means the flux is slightly reduced.
    5) The fifth part will be a label whether the tables are 2D or 3D.
       In the former they will have aa in the name, which means
       azimuth-averaged.
       In the latter there will be no fifth part.
       This service has been designed to look for this string specifically to
       validate the input files together with the requested output binning.

    Each of these sections of the file name are separated by a hyphen, and they
    should all have the file extension '.d'.
    All of the tables in PISA can be found in pisa.utils/flux.
    PISA actively supports the following tables from Honda:

    * honda-2015-spl-solmax-aa.d
    * honda-2015-spl-solmin-aa.d
    * honda-2015-spl-solmax.d
    * honda-2015-spl-solmin.d

    As of the time of writing this service, these tables represented the latest
    and greatest output from the Honda group.
    The use of azimuth-averaged tables is recommended for the energies IceCube
    works with, but the ability to read 3D tables has also been included here.

    PISA also contains the following other tables:

    * honda-2012-spl-solmax-aa.d
    * honda-2012-spl-solmin-aa.d
    * honda-2012-spl-solmax.d
    * honda-2012-spl-solmin.d
    * honda-2011-frj-mountain-solmin-aa.d

    These are included for legacy purposes and are NOT recommended to be used.
    If you access the Honda website linked above you will notice that the 2012
    South Pole files listed here are NOT on that website.
    This is because they were given to the IceCube collaboration as an interim
    while Honda was between major releases of the simulation.
    They are known to be buggy and have problems which have been fixed with the
    release of the 2014/15 simulation.
    Please only use these tables when reproducing old results that also used
    them.
    The Frejus file is also included as a legacy since it was used for some of
    the very first PINGU results.
    It is not buggy per se, but since we have a better alternative please don't
    use it.

    To choose the tables file you wish for your PISA analysis, set 'flux_file'
    in your pipeline settings file to the desired file with the prefix 'flux/'
    so that the find_resource function knows where to find it.

    Once the tables have been read in, an interpolation is then performed on
    them.
    Currently PISA supports two methods for this with the Honda files:

    1) 'bisplrep' - A simple b-spline representation.

       Here, the data is splined in both energy and cosZenith dimensions
       simultaneously.
       This is done in log10 of the flux to make it more stable since the flux
       is mostly linear in this space as a function of energy.
       We use the SciPy module 'scipy.interpolate.bisplrep' to do this (hence
       the name of this interpolation method).
       This stands for Bivariate Spline Representation (Bivariate since it is
       done in two dimensions simultaneously).
       These splines are then just evaluated at the desired points using the
       function 'scipy.interpolate.bisplev'.

    2) 'integral-preserving' - A slower, but more accurate choice.

       Here, the data is manipulated in sets of 1D splines.
       When initialising this method, a spline is produced as a function of
       energy for every table cosZenith value.
       However, in order to be integral-preserving, these splines are of the
       integrated flux.
       This is implemented by summing the bin contents along the chosen
       dimension.
       Thus, the knots of this spline are the bin edges of the tables, so this
       method naturally gives the correct flux up to the boundaries which the
       bisplrep method does not.
       Not only this, but this is in fact the correct method by which to
       interpolate the tables, since the values provided are the average across
       the bin and NOT the value at the bin center.
       The splining is done using the scipy.interpolate.splrep function.

       In any case, these splines as a function of energy are of the integral
       of the product of flux and energy, since this makes the splining more
       stable. To evaluate the integral-preserved flux, the derivative of this
       spline is evaluated.
       This is achieved with the 'scipy.interpolate.splev' function with the
       argument 'der=1' (it defaults to 'der=0' i.e. direct evaluation of the
       spline).
       This is done for every spline in the set over all cosZenith and gives
       another set of points in that dimension at the required energy.
       One then just repeats the method of integration in this dimension (this
       time of just flux since it is stable enough and also makes no sense to
       multiply by cosZenith since we will get sign switches) and evaluates the
       derivative at the required cosZenith value.

       This method only works when the binning is constant.
       Thus, it must actually be done in the energy dimension as log10 of
       energy.
       With this, the Honda tables have a constant binning.
       Since this bin width was not accounted for in the integration, we
       instead account for it once the derivative is taken by multiplying by
       this bin width.
       This is a constant (for each dimension) set by the original tables.
       Since this is always consistent in the Honda tables they are hard-coded
       in this service.
       This is potentially something which may trip people up in the future.

    To choose between these, set 'flux_mode' in your pipeline settings file to
    either 'bisplrep' or 'integral-preserving'.
    Setting it to the latter is slower, but the recommended choice.
