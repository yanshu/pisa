"""
This module sets up the logging system by looking for a "logging.json"
configuration file. It will search (in this order) the local directory, $PISA
and finally the package resources. The loggers found in there will be lifted
to the module namespace.

Currently, we have three loggers
* root: generic for what is going on  (typically: `opening file x` or
  `doing this now` messages)
* physics: for any physics output that might be interesting
  (`have x many events`, `the flux is ...`)
* tprofile: for how much time it takes to run some step (in the format of
  `time : start bla`, `time : stop bla`)

The last one is temporary and should be replaced by a proper profiler.
