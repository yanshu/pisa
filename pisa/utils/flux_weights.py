"""
A set of functions for calculating flux weights given an array of energy and
cos(zenith) values based on the Honda atmospheric flux tables. A lot of this
functionality will be copied from honda.py but since I don't want to initialise
this as a stage it makes sense to copy it in to here so somebody can't
accidentally do the wrong thing with that script.
