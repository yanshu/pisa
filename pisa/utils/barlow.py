A class to handle the likelihood calculations in OscFit. It can
 be used in other poisson binned-likelihood calculators as well.
 The class includes two likelihood spaces: the Poisson and the
 Barlow LLH.

The Poisson likelihood is the ideal case and assumes infinite
 statistical accuracy on the Monte Carlo distributions. This is
 the simple case and has been used in the past for analyses, but
 should not be used if there's a significant statistical error on
 one of the samples.

The Barlow likelihood is an implementation of the likelihood model
 given in doi:10.1016/0010-4655(93)90005-W ("Fitting using finite
 Monte Carlo samples" by Barlow and Beeston). This requires the
 unweighted distributions of the MC and involves assuming that each
 MC samples is drawn from an underlying "true" expectation distribution
 which should be fit. This gives (number of bins)x(number of samples)
 new parameters to fit and allows the shape of the distributions to
 fluctuate in order to fit both the observed MC and the observed
 data. This gives a more informed result and allows one to estimate
 the effect of the finite MC samples.

To use this, you need to run  SetData, SetMC, and the SetUnweighted
 functions. THE SetMC FUNCTION TAKES A HISTOGRAM OF THE AVERAGE
 WEIGHT PER EVENT FOR EACH BIN! NOT THE TOTAL WEIGHTED HISTOGRAM!

 Simply calling the GetLLH function after these will return the
 best fit LLH for your chosen likelihood function. The function takes
 the name of the likelihood space ("Poisson" or "Barlow"). You can
 retrieve the best fit weighted plots using the GetPlot (total best-fit
 histogram including all samples) and the GetSinglePlots (the list
 of best-fit weighted histograms for each sample).
